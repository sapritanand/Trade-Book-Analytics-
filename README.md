# Options Trading Strategy Backtesting and Analysis

This project focuses on backtesting and analyzing an options trading strategy using historical data. It aims to evaluate the strategy's performance, identify profitable patterns, and assess risk and reward metrics.

**Key Features:**

* **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Reads trading data from a CSV file, handles missing values, removes duplicates, and prepares the data for analysis.
* **Performance Metrics Calculation:** Calculates a range of key performance indicators (KPIs) including total profit/loss, win rate, average win/loss, Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and more.
* **Trade Analysis:** Examines trade outcomes (SL hit, target hit), trade duration, and the impact of implied volatility changes.
* **Strategy Evaluation:** Investigates the strategy's performance across different instruments (Call/Put), strikes, and market conditions (VIX).
* **Risk Assessment:** Analyzes risk/reward ratios, identifies outliers in profit/loss and PCR values, and assesses potential risk factors.
* **Visualization:** Presents performance trends, risk metrics, and trade distributions using informative charts and graphs (line plots, box plots, histograms).
* **Statistical Analysis:** Applies statistical techniques to derive insights into profitable trade characteristics and potential correlations with market indicators.
